# numma
Toolbox for identification of non-random associations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ramellose/numma.svg?token=9mhqeTh13MErxyrk5zR8&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ramellose/numma)

This toolbox is intended to identify conserved or unique associations across multiple networks.
While carrying out set operations on such networks can help you find such associations,
there is a chance that the outcome of the set operation was caused by random overlap between the networks.
_numma_ helps you identify if your biological networks have set operations that have different outcomes than would be expected by chance.
The simulated case study included with _numma_ can also help you design your experiments. The paper describing this case study is currently in preparation.

This version is still in early alpha and has been tested for Python 3.6.

## Getting Started

To install _numma_, run:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ramellose/numma.git
```


For a quick demo, run _numma_ as follows, with the output filepath changed to something suitable for your system.
When specifying the filepath, include the full path and a prefix for naming files.
For example, _numma_ will save a csv file to numma_demo_sets.csv with the command below.
```
numma -i demo -o C://Documents//numma_demo -draw -sample
```

The demo data for _numma_ was downloaded from the following publication:
Meyer, K. M., Memiaghe, H., Korte, L., Kenfack, D., Alonso, A., & Bohannan, B. J. (2018).
Why do microbes exhibit weak biogeographic patterns?. The ISME journal, 12(6), 1404.

To run the script, only two arguments are required: input and output filepaths.
The script recognizes gml, graphml and txt files by their extension.
The text files should be edge lists, with the third column containing edge weight.
```
numma -i filepath1.graphml filepath2.gml filepath3.txt -o filepath_to_output
```

_numma_ generates null models with permutations of the original network.
By default, the null model preserves the degree distribution, but it can also be changed.
```
numma -n deg        # preserves degree
numma -n random     # changes degree
```

The set sizes are calculated for the difference set and the intersection set by default.
You can also choose to calculate the set sizes for all possible intersections of a number of the networks, i.e. each edge that was present on 2 out of 5 networks.
If you flag the sign option, signs of edge weights are taken into account.
The set difference can then have edges that have a unique edge sign in one network but a different edge sign in all others.
In contrast, the set intersection will only include edges that have the same sign across the networks.

```
numma -set difference intersection       # Default calculates sizes of difference and intersection sets
numma -size 2 4 6                        # Calculates null models for edges present in partial intersections
numma -sign                              # Includes edge sign in set calculation
```

If you want to know how the set sizes change when you increase the number of replicates,
use the flag below; this will calculate set sizes for all numbers of networks up to the total.
```
numma -sample
```

For a complete explanation of all the parameters, run:
```
numma -h
```
